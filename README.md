# ML for Image and Object Recognition  
# Practical Works – Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods

This repository collects nine practical works (PWs) carried out in the context of the **ML for Image and Object Recognition** course at Telecom Paris. Each practical explores a different methodology in machine learning and computer vision, from classical algorithms to deep neural networks.

## Contents

### PW1 – Unsupervised Learning  
Explores dimensionality reduction with PCA, Kernel PCA, and ICA, starting from toy datasets and then applying them to real-world face data.  

### PW2 – SVM for Skin Lesion Classification  
Applies Support Vector Machines and related classifiers to melanoma detection, using handcrafted features extracted from dermoscopic images.  

### PW3 – Introduction to Supervised ML  
Implements and evaluates classical supervised methods (LDA, QDA, logistic regression, k-NN, Naive Bayes) for emotion recognition from facial landmarks.  

### PW4 – Multi-Layer Perceptron (Part 1)  
Builds a simple MLP from scratch in Python, implementing forward propagation, cost computation, backpropagation, and gradient descent for binary classification.  

### PW5 – Multi-Layer Perceptron (Part 2)  
Introduces PyTorch basics, covering tensors, automatic differentiation, and the implementation of simple neural network operations.  

### PW6 – Multi-Layer Perceptron (Part 3)  
Extends the MLP implementation to PyTorch, training and evaluating models with standard optimizers and loss functions on synthetic datasets.  

### PW7 – Convolutional Neural Networks (Part 1)  
Implements a CNN in PyTorch for image recognition, applied to MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, exploring convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.  

### PW8 – Convolutional Neural Networks (Part 2)  
Introduces advanced CNN applications, including **Deep Dream** visualizations and **adversarial examples**, to understand and challenge network robustness.  

### PW9 – Alzheimer Prediction with MRI  
Uses machine learning models (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests) on neuroimaging data (gray matter density features from T1w MRI) to classify Alzheimer’s patients and controls.
